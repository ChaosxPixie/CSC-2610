<!--Chat GPT links, I thought this would be easier than it was... I ended up using bits 
  of all versions of the code given from the AI to improve my code in the way
 that I wanted it to work. The complexity of the syntax was allievieated but
 some comprehensible things were harder to understand with out further research.-->

 <!--This was initially to generate an understanding of how to set up bootsrap and jQuery
  in the laziest of ways, however, images were not set up and no boundaries were defined
  so a game was created based off of a target vs the images, no nav bar... etc.

 <!--This was after I gotten annoyed with the first chat, I decided to attempt a restart
  this attempt was interesting seeing as how it initially generated a template and I was 
  able to work in and out of there. By the end of this one I had something put together, 
  but ended up noticing that both chats gave me code that had the image following the mouse,
  not running from it.

<!--Finally I used the AI to help simplify and make my code more concise,
  many times, and often it would turn into something I did not want and I would 
  have to alter my wording and ask for simplification over and over.
